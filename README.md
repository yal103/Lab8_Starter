How are graceful degradation and service workers related?
> Graceful degradation is a design process that is all about making sure that a website works even if some features are not supported by a browser. It is about adding many features to a website while ensuring that the core functionality of the site remains the same. Service workers fit into this idea because they help websites work offline and manage the cache only if the browser supports them. If a browser does not support the service worker, the website still functions. It just ignores the service worker part and falls back to its default behavior. This means that the website is still usable, which falls in line with the ideas of graceful degradation.
